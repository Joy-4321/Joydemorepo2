Hello and welcome, I am making good progress here.

how to push code to your github.
generate the key from the terminal, using the ssh command. 
it will create a path where the key will be store, noth the path so you can get the name of the folder.
get the key generated and copy it to your github and add it there, the start the agent to run on the background, use the the
name of the key name .pub to get the publich name and just the key name is your private key for future verification, which proves the repo is yours. 
then go to your vs code and confirm the name of your branch and then run the command.
git push origin master or main.
go to github and confirm your push.

Branchinh now.
